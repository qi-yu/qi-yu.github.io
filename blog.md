### About This Page

I used to write a lot of fan fictions, but my focus has shifted to creating fan art. Yet, the urge to write still lingers within me. One day, a friend suggested, "Why not start a blog?"

And so, here I am.

I write mostly in German because it's much easier for me (even if my appearance might not suggest this).
