        <h2 class="page-heading">ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p><b><u>News</u></b> - Iâ€™m extremely glad to announce that in July 2024, I will:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>submit my dissertation</b>, and...</li> 
<li><b>join <a href="https://www.gft.com/int/en" target="_blank">GFT Technologies</a> as a software developer ðŸ’™ðŸ’œ.</b> 
I will be based in <a href="https://www.gft.com/de/de/technology/gft-software-solutions" target="_blank">GFT Integrated Systems</a> in Konstanz, sitting at the beautiful Rhine. <br />
The transition from data science to software development isn't new to me, 
but I'm still eagerly looking forward to the changes and challenges this completely different professional life will bring.
</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>From March 2020 to May 2024, I worked as a doctoral researcher in natural language processing (NLP) at the Cluster of Excellence "The Politics of Inequality", 
University of Konstanz. During this time, I developed <b>machine learning and statistical solutions</b> for the automated detection of framing strategies in journalistic texts.
Broadly, my research interests included: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for large-scale text analyses in social sciences</li>
  <li>Statistical modelling and machine learning approaches for sparse design matrices or rare events</li>
  <li>Analysis of the behavior patterns of large language models (LLMs)</li>
</ul>

            <u>More about my background</u>
          </span>
          <div class="description">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
              My interests nowadays is strongly situated in informatics. Yet, my path to this field has been rather untypical - or, as some people have said to me, "very untypical".
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
              Earlier, I completed my bachelor's degree in Scandinavian Studies (Beijing Foreign Studies University, with a one-year state-funded exchange at the University of Southern Denmark),
              a study program with a mixed focus on literature and political science.
              As it is very unusual to study Scandinavian Studies in China (also, this study program only accepts around 15 new students every four years), I was often asked why I made this choice.
              Honestly, this was not a desired <i>choice</i> of mine at all: back to that time, I wished to study German linguistics due to my fascination with several rock/gothic bands from the German-speaking region.
              But in the higher education system in my country, especially contrasted with the German one where I currently reside, there is extremely limited freedom to choose the field of study or switch the study program.
              Instead, the priority was to play safe and secure a study place at any of the prestigious universities - no matter in which subject - rather than to choose a subject that follows one's personal interests.
              Due to several complicated reasons related to this, I ended up with a bachelor in Scandinavian studies.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
              But I consciously worked towards my passion at that time, learning German and indeed moved to Germany to study linguistics later on.
              I received a master's degree in Speech and Language Processing (2019, with a focus on computational linguistics)
              and a master's degree in General Linguistics (2020, with a focus on formal semantics) from the University of Konstanz.
              While my huge passion for the German language still lasts until today (and keeps growing larger every day), it turned out at a later time that NLP / software development fascinate me much more than German linguistics.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
              Why? I'd say that it comes from my personal preference for hands-on things.
              In my student life, I slowly found out that I prefer implementing tangible solutions, where I can see deterministic results on whether it works or not.
              During my master's study, I worked quite a lot on formal methods for linguistics (formal semantics and formal pragmatics), a very theoretical field using mathematical methods (predicate logic, set theory, lambda calculus, etc.) to analyze natural language.
              While this strand of research is interesting, I struggled quite a few times with the question
              "ok, now we have a formal model for phenomenon X, but how can we apply this to the real world?" <b><sup>1</sup></b>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
              (<b><sup>1</sup></b> A small, small disclaimer: this is not to be interpreted in the sense that I am anti-intellectual and against fundamental research for which one does not find an immediate application. It's just a personal *preference* for conducting applied research over fundamental research.
              As a person who has worked four years in research, I see the merit of fundamental research, and my forthcoming dissertation will demonstrate how NLP applications can benefit from many well-studied phenomena in theoretical linguistics.
              That said, I do see some of the work in formal semantics as a kind of <i>over-mathematization</i>, which is nothing but pseudo-science.)
