<b><u>News</u></b> - I'm extremely glad to announce that in July 2024, I will: 

<ul>
<li><b>submit my dissertation</b>, and...</li> 
<li><b>join <a href="https://www.gft.com/int/en" target="_blank">GFT Technologies</a> as a software developer ðŸ’™ðŸ’œ.</b> 
I will be based in <a href="https://www.gft.com/de/de/technology/gft-software-solutions" target="_blank">GFT Integrated Systems</a> in Konstanz, sitting at the beautiful Rhine. <br>
The transition from data science to software development isn't new to me, 
but I'm still eagerly looking forward to the changes and challenges this completely different professional life will bring.
</li>
</ul>

<p>From March 2020 to May 2024, I worked as an academic staff member in <b>natural language processing (NLP)</b> at the Cluster of Excellence "The Politics of Inequality", 
University of Konstanz. During this time, I developed <b>machine learning and statistical solutions</b> for the automated detection of framing strategies in journalistic texts. 
My dissertation, which will be defended in October, also focuses on automated framing detection. 
See the tabs <a href="https://qi-yu.github.io/projects">Research Projects</a> and <a href="https://qi-yu.github.io/publication">Publications & Talks</a> for a detailed collection of my research outputs.
