Previously, I worked as an academic staff member in natural language processing (NLP) at the University of Konstanz (March 2020 - May 2024), 
where I developed <b>machine learning and statistical solutions</b> to detect framing strategies in journalistic texts.

<p class="text-block">
I earned my PhD degree in October 2024 - proudly with the highest distinction <b style="background: linear-gradient(to right, red, orange, green, blue, indigo, violet); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent; letter-spacing: 2px;">SUMMA CUM LAUDE</b>! <br>
See the tabs <a href="https://qi-yu.github.io/projects">Research Projects</a> and <a href="https://qi-yu.github.io/publication">Publications</a> for my research outputs.

When I'm not coding, I am...<br>
<ul>
  <li>extremely obsessed with <a href="https://qi-yu.github.io/horcrux/">creating fan art</a>.</li>
  <li>occasionally obsessed with writing fan fictions.</li>
  <li>a football fan. Mostly into the DFB, but sometimes go down rabbit holes of '90s and 2000s football.</li>
  <li>a Gothic fan, but just never dress in black or wear dark makeup.</li>
  <li>a fan of My Little Pony. This explains why I love colors and avoid dressing in black.</li>
</ul>
