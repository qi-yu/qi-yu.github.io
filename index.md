<h2 class="page-heading">MY ACADEMIC PATH</h2>
<p>Since March 2020, I am working as a <b>doctoral researcher in natural language processing (NLP)</b> at the Cluster of Excellence "The Politics of Inequality", 
<b>University of Konstanz</b>. My current work is part of the project <a href="https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/en/inequality/research/projects/framing-inequalities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Framing Inequalities</a>, 
where I focus on the automated detection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">framing</a> in journalistic texts using NLP approaches.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:1cm;">I received a master's degree in Speech and Language Processing (2019, with a focus on NLP) and a master's degree
in General Linguistics (2020, with a focus on formal semantics) from the University of Konstanz.</p>


<h2 class="page-heading">RESEARCH INTERESTS</h2>
<p>Broadly, I am passionate about applying <b>machine learning</b> and <b>statistical approaches</b> to explore large-scale datasets, with a particular focus on textual data. 

My interests include:
<ul>
  <li>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for large-scale text analyses in computational social science</li>
  <li>Statistical modelling and machine learning approaches for sparse design matrices or rare events</li>
  <li>Analyses examining the behavior patterns of large language models (LLMs)</li>
</ul>
