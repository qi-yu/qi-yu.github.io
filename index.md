<p>
In March 2020, I started my journey in the academic world as a PhD candidate in computational linguistics and a research fellow (<i>Wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiter</i>) at the Cluster of Excellence "The Politics of Inequality", 
University of Konstanz.

<p>
My work is part of the project <a href="https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/en/inequality/research/projects/framing-inequalities/">Framing Inequalities</a>, 
where I focus on the automated detection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences)">frames</a> in political discourses using state-of-the-art NLP approaches.
