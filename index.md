<h2 class="page-heading">MY ACADEMIC PATH</h2>
<p>Since 2020, I am working as a <b>doctoral researcher in natural language processing (NLP)</b> at the Cluster of Excellence "The Politics of Inequality", 
<b>University of Konstanz</b>. My work is part of the project <a href="https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/en/inequality/research/projects/framing-inequalities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Framing Inequalities</a>, 
where I focus on the automated detection of <i>framing</i> in journalistic texts (a ubiquitous persuasive strategy to promote opinions; see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>) using NLP techniques.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0.5cm;">I received a master's degree in Speech and Language Processing (2019, with a focus on NLP) and a master's degree
in General Linguistics (2020, with a focus on formal semantics) from the University of Konstanz.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0.5cm;"> Earlier, I completed my bachelor's degree in Scandinavian Studies (Beijing Foreign Studies University, with a one-year state-funded exchange at the University of Southern Denmark). 
As it is very unusual to study Scandinavian Studies in China (also, this study program which only accepts around 15 new students every four years), I was often asked why I made this choice. 
Honestly, this was not desired by me at all: I rather wished to study German linguistics due to my fascination with several rock/gothic bands from the German-speaking region at that time. 
But in the higher education system at my country, especially contrasted with the German one where I currently reside, there is extremely limited freedom to choose the field of study or switch the study program. 
Instead, the priority was to play safe and secure a study place at any of the prestigious universities - no matter for which subject - rather than to follow personal interests.

<p style="margin-bottom:0.5cm;"> But over time, my interest shifted strongly towards informatics. Yet, my passion for the German language still lasts until today.

<h2 class="page-heading">RESEARCH INTERESTS</h2>
<p>Broadly, I am passionate about applying <b>machine learning</b> and <b>statistical approaches</b> to explore large-scale datasets, with a particular focus on textual data. 

Specifically, my interests include:
<ul>
  <li>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for large-scale text analyses in computational social science</li>
  <li>Statistical modelling and machine learning approaches for sparse design matrices or rare events</li>
  <li>Analysis of the behavior patterns of large language models (LLMs)</li>
</ul>
