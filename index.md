I defended my PhD dissertation in October 2024 - and proudly earned <b style="background: linear-gradient(to right, red, orange, green, blue, indigo, violet); -webkit-background-clip: text; color: transparent; letter-spacing: 2px;">SUMMA CUM LAUDE</b>! ðŸ¥°

<p>
My dissertation emerged from my previous job as an academic staff member in <b>natural language processing (NLP)</b> at the University of Konstanz (March 2020 - May 2024). During this time, I developed <b>machine learning and statistical solutions</b> to automatically detect framing strategies in journalistic texts. See the tabs <a href="https://qi-yu.github.io/projects">Research Projects</a> and <a href="https://qi-yu.github.io/publication">Publications</a> for my research outputs.
