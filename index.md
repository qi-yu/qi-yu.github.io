I am a <b>software developer</b> at <b><a href="https://www.gft.com/int/en" target="_blank">GFT Technologies</a></b> (since July 2024).<br>

Previously, I worked as an academic staff member in natural language processing (NLP) at the University of Konstanz (March 2020 - May 2024), 
where I developed <b>machine learning and statistical solutions</b> to detect framing strategies in journalistic texts.
