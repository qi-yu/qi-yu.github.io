<p>
In March 2020, I started my journey in the research world as a PhD student in computational linguistics and a research fellow (<i>Wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin</i>) at the Cluster of Excellence "The Politics of Inequality", 
University of Konstanz. 
</p>
<p>
My work is part of the project <a href="https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/en/inequality/research/projects/framing-inequalities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Framing Inequalities</a>, 
where I focus on the automated detection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">framing</a> in print media using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches.
</p>
<p>I am passionate about applying machine learning and statistical approaches to explore big data, especially text data. Broadly, my interests include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Text Mining and Information Extraction</li>
  <li>Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP</li>
  <li>Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)</li>
</ul>
