I am a <b>software developer</b> at <a href="https://www.gft.com/int/en" target="_blank">GFT Technologies</a> (since July 2024). ðŸ’™ðŸ’œ<br>
I'm based at <b><a href="https://www.gft.com/de/de/technology/gft-software-solutions" target="_blank">GFT Software Solutions</a></b> in Konstanz, located along the beautiful Rhine River. <br>

<p>From March 2020 to May 2024, I worked as an academic staff member in <b>natural language processing (NLP)</b> at the Cluster of Excellence "The Politics of Inequality", 
University of Konstanz. During this time, I developed <b>machine learning and statistical solutions</b> for the automated detection of framing strategies in journalistic texts. 
My <b>dissertation</b>, which was submitted in July 2024 and will be defended in October 2024, also focuses on automated framing detection. 
See the tabs <a href="https://qi-yu.github.io/projects">Research Projects</a> and <a href="https://qi-yu.github.io/publication">Publications & Talks</a> for a detailed collection of my research outputs.
