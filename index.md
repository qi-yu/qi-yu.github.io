<b><u>News</u></b> - I'm extremely glad to announce that in July 2024, I will: 

<ul>
<li><b>submit my dissertation</b>, and...</li> 
<li><b>join <a href="https://www.gft.com/int/en" target="_blank">GFT Technologies</a> as a software developer ðŸ’™ðŸ’œ.</b> Having been deeply interested in software development for quite a while, I am now eagerly looking forward to my new role and all the challenges this completely new world will bring. </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>From March 2020 to May 2024, I worked as a doctoral researcher in natural language processing (NLP) at the Cluster of Excellence "The Politics of Inequality", 
University of Konstanz. My work was part of the project "<a href="https://www.exc.uni-konstanz.de/en/inequality/research/projects/framing-inequalities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Framing Inequalities</a>", 
where I developed NLP solutions for the automated detection of framing strategies in journalistic texts.
Being passionate about applying <b>machine learning</b> and <b>statistical approaches</b> to explore large-scale datasets (with a focus on textual data), my research interests broadly included: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for large-scale text analyses in social sciences</li>
  <li>Statistical modelling and machine learning approaches for sparse design matrices or rare events</li>
  <li>Analysis of the behavior patterns of large language models (LLMs)</li>
</ul>
