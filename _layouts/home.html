          <div class="description">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
              I received a master's degree in Speech and Language Processing (2019, with a focus on NLP)
              and a master's degree in General Linguistics (2020, with a focus on formal semantics) from the University of Konstanz.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
              Earlier, I completed my bachelor's degree in Scandinavian Studies (Beijing Foreign Studies University, with a one-year state-funded exchange at the University of Southern Denmark).
              As it is very unusual to study Scandinavian Studies in China (also, this study program which only accepts around 15 new students every four years), I was often asked why I made this choice.
              Honestly, this was not desired by me at all: I rather wished to study German linguistics due to my fascination with several rock/gothic bands from the German-speaking region at that time.
              But in the higher education system at my country, especially contrasted with the German one where I currently reside, there is extremely limited freedom to choose the field of study or switch the study program.
              Instead, the priority was to play safe and secure a study place at any of the prestigious universities - no matter for which subject - rather than to choose a subject that follows one's personal interests.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
              But over time, my interest shifted strongly towards informatics. Yet, my passion for the German language still lasts until today.
