<!--            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">-->
<!--              My interests nowadays is strongly situated in informatics. Yet, my path to this field has been rather untypical - or, as some people have said to me, "very untypical".-->
<!--            </p>-->
<!--            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">-->
<!--              Earlier, I completed my bachelor's degree in Scandinavian Studies (2016) at Beijing Foreign Studies University, with a one-year state-funded exchange at the University of Southern Denmark.-->
<!--              This is a study program with a mixed focus on language, literature and political science.-->
<!--              As it is very unusual to study Scandinavian Studies in China (also, this study program only accepts around 15 new students every four years), I was often asked why I made this choice.-->
<!--              Honestly, this was not a desired <i>choice</i> of mine at all: back to that time, I wished to study German linguistics due to my fascination with several rock/gothic bands from the German-speaking region.-->
<!--              But in the higher education system in my country, especially contrasted with the German one where I currently reside, there is extremely limited freedom to choose the field of study or switch the study program.-->
<!--              Instead, the priority was to play safe and secure a study place at any of the prestigious universities - no matter in which subject - rather than to choose a subject that follows one's personal interests.-->
<!--              Due to several complicated reasons related to this, I ended up with a bachelor in Scandinavian studies.-->
<!--            </p>-->
<!--            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">-->
<!--              But I consciously worked towards my interest in German linguistics at that time. I learned German, and indeed moved to Germany to study linguistics later on.-->
<!--              I earned a master's degree in Speech and Language Processing (2019, with a focus on computational linguistics)-->
<!--              and a master's degree in General Linguistics (2020, with a focus on formal semantics) from the University of Konstanz.-->
<!--              While my huge passion for the German language still lasts until today (and keeps growing stronger every day), it turned out at a later time that NLP / software development fascinate me much more than German linguistics.-->
<!--            </p>-->
<!--            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">-->
<!--              Why? I'd say that it comes from my personal preference for hands-on things.-->
<!--              In my student life, I gradually found out that I prefer implementing tangible solutions, where I can see an immediate and deterministic outcome on whether it works or not:-->
<!--              I see a program or an application growing up from my efforts, and I know that I can apply it to real-world data to solve specific problems - this is what I really enjoy.-->
<!--              During my master's study, I worked quite a lot on formal methods for linguistics (formal semantics and formal pragmatics), a very theoretical field that uses mathematical methods (predicate logic, set theory, lambda calculus, etc.) to analyze how meanings are composed from words and phrases.-->
<!--              While it was undoubtedly interesting to learn all the methodologies, I struggled quite a few times with the question-->
<!--              "ok, now we have a formal model for phenomenon X, but how can this be useful for the real world?" <b><sup>1</sup></b>-->
<!--            </p>-->
<!--            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">-->
<!--              Then, starting from the later part of my Master's studies, I began working more on NLP. Afterward, I also wrote my dissertation in this field.-->
<!--              During this time, I also developed a strong interest in software development: I am not just interested in programming loose scripts of data science solutions, but also implementing them into well-designed applications.-->
<!--              Since then, I have felt every day that I am doing the right thing that I truly enjoy.-->
<!--            </p>-->
<!--            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">-->
<!--              (<b><sup>1</sup></b> A small disclaimer: this is not to be interpreted in the sense that I am anti-intellectual and against fundamental research for which one does not find an immediate application. It's just a personal <i>preference</i> for conducting applied research over fundamental research.-->
<!--              As someone who has worked in research for four years, I see the merit of fundamental research, and my forthcoming dissertation will demonstrate how NLP applications can benefit from many well-studied phenomena in theoretical linguistics.-->
<!--              That said, I do have a somewhat radical critique of certain work in formal linguistics that use syntax trees with anecdotally defined node labels or overcomplicated lambda calculus formulars:-->
<!--              I neither see a possibility of implementing them into computer applications to facilitate artificial intelligence, nor do I believe they are really explaining how humans understand language-->
<!--              - I mean, my brain probably does not process a sentence in terms of <i>possible worlds</i> or <i>modal base</i> or any other such machineries that are so prevalent in formal semantics.-->
<!--              While mathematization is useful, <i>over-mathematization</i> is nothing but pseudo-science.)-->
